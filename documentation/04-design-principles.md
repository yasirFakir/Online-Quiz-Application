# 04 - Design Principles: Gonia-Edu

## The Gonia-Edu Philosophy
Gonia-Edu is an evolution of the Gonia design system, optimized for educational environments. It prioritizes **clarity, precision, and focus**.

## Visual Constraints
1.  **Geometry (The "Hard Edge" Rule)**:
    *   **Border Radius**: Always `0dp` (RectangleShape).
    *   No rounded corners on buttons, cards, inputs, or dialogs.
    *   This signals technical precision and academic seriousness.

2.  **Color Palette**:
    *   **Primary (Sage Green - #74B086)**: Derived from natural study environments. Used for main actions.
    *   **Secondary (Mint Green - #9BD4AD)**: Used for supporting elements and softer highlights.
    *   **Accent (Dark Charcoal - #263135)**: High-contrast text and active states.
    *   **Background (Mint White - #F3FCF6)**: A very subtle cool white to maintain focus.
    *   **Border (Gray-Green - #DAE6DF)**: Technical 1px lines.

3.  **Interaction**:
    *   **Buttons**: Flat design. No heavy gradients. 
    *   **Feedback**: Immediate visual change on click or hover.

## Typography
*   Primary Font: **Geist Sans** (or system equivalent Sans-Serif).
*   Clean, high-readability fonts only.
*   Strict hierarchy: Large bold headers, clear medium body text.
